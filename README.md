# Textual-RPG
A little project I've been working on for a year. Fully textual, no graphics. Some classes are actually OP, gonna change it soon. Have fun slaying monsters. You can stop your progress after each fight, but you don't win anything. AT ALL. Just a cookie if you can defeat 10 dragons.
Actually, there are two versions of the code : a classical one, where you are a simple warrior, salying monsters again and again, and another one, where you can choose your class. In this project, I'll publish the simple one, and then the evolved.
